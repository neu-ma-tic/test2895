## Setup

First of all, click on the "Lock" icon in the tab on the left. It will show you your repl's secrets. On this tab, add a new secret, set its name to `TOKEN` and its value to your discord bot token from the [discord developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Optionally, move to `index.js` and edit lines 6-12 (client configuration) as it suits you.
Your bot is ready to launch!

## Configuration

In the `config.js` file, you can edit your bot's command prefix as per your choice.

## Commands

The bot by default has 1 commands.


**ping** - Just a test command


## Hosting

The `server.js` file creates an HTTP server which in turn, generates a URL of the format `https://my-repl-name--my-username.repl.co` that you can ping using services such as uptimerobot. If you have the hacker plan, you can skip this and use the `Always on repl` feature.
