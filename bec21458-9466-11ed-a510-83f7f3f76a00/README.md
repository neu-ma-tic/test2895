# DiscordBot - JG Zeke

Simple discord bot made to learn Discord API.  
Most scripts are library scripts. Callable scripts are called "executable_*"  
executable_main.py - main script of Discord Bot  
executable_train_hate_classifier.py - train classifier to be used by Discord bot to scan for Hate Speech

To run programs, type in command line  
python executable_train_hate_classifier.py  
python executable_main.py  

To train classifier, you need text corpus in proper format which I explained in comments of executable_train_hate_classifier.py.  
Must be named .train_set and .test_set, and placed in classifier/ directory.

# Safety warning

This bot gathers some informations about users of Discord server and servers themself, for example number of messages posted by each user. Data is then saved without encryption. Instead, it uses Python built-in function hash() to replace ID of server and user with its' hash.

# Features

- Automated translation by using emojis, to any language supported by google translate.  
- Automated searching for pictures, and posting them on given channel.  
- Easily scaleable hate speech scanner including own implementation of Hate Speech scanner, using Bag-of-Words model  
- Automated warnings and reports management   
- Levels like in MEE6   
- Reaction Roles   
- Support for multiple servers (guilds, with separate variables & stuff)

# TO-DO

- Proper interface (commands), for now all are hardcoded for administrators and syntax is trash
- Text corpus used by me to train classifier was small, unbalanced and containing mostly sexism. To be remade. There should be classifier for: general Hate Speech, Sexism, Racism and Offensive Language. I've implemented weight system for them. Profanity check is good at detecting slurs - but it's oversensitive, so should be with lower weight.
- Definitely not all exceptions are properly handled
- Splitting messages; some messages are scallable and might overflow 2000 characters limit of Discord
- Remake for pic-post, cuz downloading so much data causes exceptions.

# Performance

This is hobby project, just to learn Discord API, so obviously performance isn't priority for me.  Most notable weakpoints:  
- Hate Speech scan requires connection with google translate, online language detector, and various tests are NOT paralleled.  
- BoW uses nltk NaiveBayesClassifier which is purely Python implementation. Switching to sklearn might vastly improve performance  
- Downloading pictures by pic_poster can take A LOT of time and jam whole bot.
