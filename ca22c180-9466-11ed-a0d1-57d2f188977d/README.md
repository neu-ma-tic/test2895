# Franky-DiscordBot

## Who's Franky?

Franky is a music Discord selfbot/userbot (it automates an user account to act as a bot and play music).

**Selfbots are against Discord's TOS, use at your own risk.**

## How does it work?

Franky has a queue that you can add songs to with ```!!add```. You can also play separate songs from the queue with ```!!play```.

## What can Franky do?

Franky is able to respond to the following commands:
- ```!!play <youtube-link>```: Download the video from *youtube-link* and play it.
- ```!!play <search-term>```: Download the first video it finds by searching *search-term* on YouTube, then play it.
- ```!!play <song-index>```: Play the song at *song-index* on queue.
- ```!!play```: If a song is paused it will unpause it, otherwise do nothing.
- ```!!add <youtube-link>```: Download video from *youtube-link*, and add it to the queue.
- ```!!add <search-term>```: Download the first video it finds by searching *search-term* on YouTube, then add it to the queue. 
- ```!!pause```: Pause the current song.
- ```!!stop```: Stop the current song and clear the queue.
- ```!!loop```: Start looping the current song.
- ```!!lq```: Toggle looping whole queue (default off).
- ```!!next```: Play next song on queue.
- ```!!last```: Play previous song on queue.
- ```!!queue```: Return the current queue.
- ```!!rm <song-index>```: Remove the song at *song-index* from queue.
- ```!!help```: Show help message containing these commands.
